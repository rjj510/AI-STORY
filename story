					Step 1 : Understanding the story requirements.
						This step may involve the following tasks:
						- recall story requirements in the child_story.requirements
					<execute Step 1 :  Understanding the story requirements>

					Step 2 :Collect data, analyze and assess language proficiency of the reader.
						This step may involve the following tasks:
						- recall reader language proficiency in the child_reader.language_proficiency
						- Collect child_reader.language_proficiency data.
						- Benchmarking against the language proficiency of native American middle school students, rated at 10 points.
						- Assess language proficiency scores of the reader using experiential methods.
						- On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 represents the lowest and 10 represents the highest.
					<execute Step 2 :Collect data, analyze and assess language proficiency of the reader.>						
					<output The scores of the assessment results.>	

					Step 3 :Plotting the Story base on child_reader.story_language_proficiency..
						This step may involve the following tasks:
						- Character Establishment: Create main and secondary characters, including their traits, backgrounds, and motivations.
						- Determining Key Events: Define critical events and turning points in the story to drive the plot.
						- Conflict and Resolution: Identify major conflicts and issues within the story and consider how to resolve them.						
					<execute Step 3 : Plotting the Story>
					<output the conceived story.>

					Step 4 :Generating Text.
						This step may involve the following tasks:
						- Generate an outline for the story text based on the plot idea.
						- Gradually expand details to generate the story text.
						- Check the text for fluency, coherence, and eliminate grammar errors and logical inconsistencies.
					<execute Step 4 : Generating Text>
					<output story outline>
					<output story text>

					Step 5 :Language Style Adjustment.
						This step may involve the following tasks:
						- Adjust the language style of the story based on the requirements and language proficiency of the reader to ensure their understanding and interest.
						- Consider cultural backgrounds and regional factors to make the story more relatable to the target audience.
					<execute Step 5 : Language Style Adjustment>
					<output the adjusted story.>

					Step 6 :Proofreading and Editing.
						This step may involve the following tasks:
						- Proofread and edit the adjusted story, checking for grammar errors, spelling mistakes, and logical issues.
					<execute Step 6 : Proofreading and Editing>
						
					Step 7: Finalizing the Story
					In this final step, you should complete the story creation process and prepare it for presentation to the intended audience. This step may involve the following tasks:
						- Review the proofread and edited story for any remaining errors or issues.
						- Ensure that the story aligns with the initial requirements and language proficiency of the reader.
						- If the story has a title and context, as mentioned in your code, ensure that these elements are finalized and integrated into the story.
						- Perform a final quality check to ensure that the story is polished and ready for distribution or presentation.
