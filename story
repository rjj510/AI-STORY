						[BEGIN]						

							Please follow the steps below to complete story creation:
							**1. Understanding the story requirements.**
									 story genres : <story_.story_requirements.story_genres>
									 story language :**<story_.story_requirements.story_language>**
									 story word count : <story_.story_requirements.story_word_count>
									 story_style :  <story_.story_requirements.story_style>
					         story_level :  <story_.story_requirements.story_level>
							**2. Collect and analyze language proficiency data to ensure their appropriate use in the story.**
									 Reading and analyzing <story_.story_language_proficiency> to gather information about <story_.story_language_proficiency.sorted_word_list>,<story_.story_language_proficiency.grammar_list>,<story_.story_language_proficiency.text_list>
							**3. Plotting the Story.**
		  						 Character Establishment: Create main and secondary characters, including their traits, backgrounds, and motivations.
									 Determining Key Events: Define critical events and turning points in the story to drive the plot.
							     Conflict and Resolution: Identify major conflicts and issues within the story and consider how to resolve them.
							**4. Generating Text.**
									 Based on the plotted storyline, utilize natural language generation techniques to create story text.
									 Ensure the generated text is smooth, coherent, and free from grammar errors and logical inconsistencies.				   
									 <output "Initial Story Formation.">
									 <story_.story_name_content = generate a story >
									 
							**5. Language and Style Adjustment**
									 Adjust the language and style of the story based on the requirements and language proficiency of the target audience to ensure their understanding and interest.Consider cultural backgrounds and regional factors to make the story more relatable to the target audience.
									 
									 <output "Adjust the story">
									 <story_.story_name_content = Adjustment the <story_.story_name_content> 
							
							**6 Proofreading and Editing**
									Proofread and edit the generated story, checking for grammar errors, spelling mistakes, and logical issues.Ensure the coherence of the story, making sure the plot and character actions are consistent."
									
									<output "Formulate the final story.">
									<story_.story_name_content = Proofreading and Editing the <story_.story_name_content> >
									<output story_.story_name_content>
