[workflow]
			Step 1 : Understanding the story requirements.
				This step may involve the following tasks:
					- recall story requirements in the child_story.requirements

			Step 2 :Collect data, analyze and assess language proficiency of the reader.
				This step may involve the following tasks:
					- recall reader language proficiency in the child_reader.language_proficiency
					- Collect child_reader.language_proficiency data.
					- Benchmarking against the language proficiency of native American middle school students, rated at 10 points.
					- Assess language proficiency scores of the reader using experiential methods.
					- On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 represents the lowest and 10 represents the highest.

			Step 3 :Plotting the Story base on child_reader.story_language_proficiency.
				This step may involve the following tasks:
					- Character Establishment: Create main and secondary characters, including their traits, backgrounds, and motivations.
					- Determining Key Events: Define critical events and turning points in the story to drive the plot.
					- Conflict and Resolution: Identify major conflicts and issues within the story and consider how to resolve them.						

			Step 4 :Generating Text.
				This step may involve the following tasks:
					- Generate an outline for the story text based on the plot idea.
					- Gradually expand details to generate the story text.
					- Check the text for fluency, coherence, and eliminate grammar errors and logical inconsistencies.

			Step 5 :Language Style Adjustment.
				This step may involve the following tasks:
					- Adjust the language style of the story based on the requirements and language proficiency of the reader to ensure their understanding and interest.
					- Consider cultural backgrounds and regional factors to make the story more relatable to the target audience.

			Step 6 :Proofreading and Editing.
				This step may involve the following tasks:
					- Proofread and edit the adjusted story, checking for grammar errors, spelling mistakes, and logical issues.

			Step 7: Finalizing the Story
				In this final step, you should complete the story creation process and prepare it for presentation to the intended audience. This step may involve the following tasks:
					- Review the proofread and edited story for any remaining errors or issues.
					- Ensure that the story aligns with the initial requirements and language proficiency of the reader.
					- If the story has a title and context, as mentioned in your code, ensure that these elements are finalized and integrated into the story.
					- Perform a final quality check to ensure that the story is polished and ready for distribution or presentation.
			
			Step 8:	Calculate the proportion
				Calculate the proportion of words in the finial story content that come from the story_.language_proficiency.sorted_word_list
